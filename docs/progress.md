- Set up folder structure following Next.js App Router best practices including grouping of routes by main features -> [(Next.js Route Grouping and other best practises)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#route-groups)
- Created components/, services/, utils/ based on SOLID separation of concerns and Next.js best practices
- Added .gitkeep to keep folders tracked in Git while empty
- Created initial README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and progress.md files
- Decided not to use TypeScript (yet) to keep scope manageable
